// Orphan-reaping regression tests. The reported bug: a daemon that dies without a
// clean shutdown (terminal window closed, killed, crashed) leaves llama-server running
// "independently" — still holding the model in RAM/VRAM and draining its queue — while
// a freshly started daemon shows "no model loaded". The fix tracks each engine in a
// pidfile and reaps survivors on the next startup. These tests pin that contract:
//   • a tracked process whose engine port is still alive → killed, pidfile removed
//   • a tracked entry whose port is dead → NOT killed (pid may be recycled), file cleared
