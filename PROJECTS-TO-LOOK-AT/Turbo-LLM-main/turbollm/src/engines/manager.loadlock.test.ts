// Global load-lock regression tests (rules 1 & 2): only ONE model load/reload may be
// in flight at a time, no matter who requests it — even across SEPARATE Manager
// instances (the gateway keep-N pool uses extra Managers). The lock is a static gate
// shared by every Manager, held through readiness, so two engines can never spin up at
// once. This test drives two Managers concurrently and asserts their loads serialise.
