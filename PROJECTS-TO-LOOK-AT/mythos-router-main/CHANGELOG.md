## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Verified Cost-Router (`--escalate`)** - Opt-in escalation-by-verification for `chat` and `run`. The session runs at the chosen `--effort` (e.g. `low`/Haiku) and climbs exactly one model tier per SWD Correction Turn — and *only* when verification actually fails — clamped by `--escalate-to <level>` (default ceiling `high`). If the cheap tier's file actions verify, the expensive tier is never invoked. This is orthogonal to the orchestrator's existing provider-level circuit-breaker fallback: escalation is gated on verified failure, not on a difficulty guess or a provider outage. The policy lives in `src/escalation.ts` as pure, fully-tested functions (`effortForCorrection`, `nextEffort`, `parseEscalationConfig`) and is exported from the SDK. Default behavior is unchanged when the flag is absent.
- **Self-Improving Skills (`mythos skills suggest`)** - Mines local SWD receipts for file actions that repeatedly fail verification, classifies the recurring failure (content drift, no-op mutate, missing target, oversized write), and proposes plain-language `SKILL.md` rules to prevent them. Read-only by default and `--json`-capable, mirroring `mythos policy suggest`; `--write` persists the generated skill (guarded by `--force`, validated on write), `--min-occurrences <n>` sets the recurrence threshold (default 2), and `--limit <n>` bounds how many recent receipts are analyzed (default 50). Analysis lives in `src/skill-learning.ts` as a pure function over receipts and is exported from the SDK. Added `readReceipts()` to read full receipt records (not just summaries).



### Fixed
- **Memory: FTS5 search accepts arbitrary user queries** - `searchMemory` passed the raw query to FTS5 `MATCH`, so inputs like `c++`, `don't`, or anything with an unbalanced quote were FTS5 syntax errors surfacing as an empty result plus a warning. Queries are now tokenized and each term is passed as a quoted FTS5 string (OR-joined); queries with no usable tokens return empty without touching FTS5.
- **SWD: aborted batches are fully reported** - When execution threw mid-batch, actions that had already been applied (and were then rolled back) produced no entry in the run results, under-reporting the receipt's audit trail. They are now recorded explicitly as `failed` with an "applied but not verified; rollback attempted" detail.
- **SWD: rollback removes directories it created** - A rolled-back `CREATE` into a new nested directory previously left the empty directory chain behind. Directories created by the run are now tracked and removed during rollback, deepest-first, only while empty — pre-existing directories and non-empty directories are never touched.
- **SWD: rollback no longer re-attempts a failed path** - A path appearing twice in the execution order could be rolled back (and error-reported) twice when the first attempt failed; each path is now attempted exactly once.
- **Parser: traversal check is segment-based** - Path validation rejected any path *containing* `..`, which also blocked legitimate filenames like `backup..old.txt`. Only a real `..` path segment is rejected now; `resolveSafePath` continues to re-validate at execution time.
- **Heal loop: failure counting ignores zero-count phrasings** - The regression-warning heuristic counted every `fail`/`error` substring, so summaries like `# fail 0`, `0 failures`, or identifiers like `errorHandler` inflated the count. It now prefers explicit numeric counters (`3 failed`, `failures: 2`, `# fail 0`) and otherwise counts standalone tokens, skipping `no`/`0`-prefixed mentions. Extracted to `countTestFailures` in `utils.ts` (heuristic only — it never gates a decision).
- **Line endings normalized + enforced** - `src/memory.ts` and `src/commands/verify.ts` were CRLF while the rest of the repo was LF. Both are normalized to LF and a new `.gitattributes` enforces LF repo-wide, preventing false `receipts verify` drift reports on Windows checkouts with `core.autocrlf=true` (receipt hashes are byte-sensitive).

---

## [1.18.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Orchestrator: status-code matching is no longer substring-based** - `isRetryableError` matched retryable status codes anywhere in the error message, so text like `"15029 bytes"` or `"req_5290"` looked like a 502/529 and triggered spurious (potentially billable) retries. A numeric `status`/`statusCode`/`response.status` property on the error object is now authoritative, with a digit-boundary token match as the message-only fallback.
- **Memory: FTS5 search accepts arbitrary user queries** - `searchMemory` passed the raw query to FTS5 `MATCH`, so inputs like `c++`, `don't`, or anything with an unbalanced quote were FTS5 syntax errors surfacing as an empty result plus a warning. Queries are now tokenized and each term is passed as a quoted FTS5 string (OR-joined); queries with no usable tokens return empty without touching FTS5.
- **SWD: aborted batches are fully reported** - When execution threw mid-batch, actions that had already been applied (and were then rolled back) produced no entry in the run results, under-reporting the receipt's audit trail. They are now recorded explicitly as `failed` with an "applied but not verified; rollback attempted" detail.
- **SWD: rollback removes directories it created** - A rolled-back `CREATE` into a new nested directory previously left the empty directory chain behind. Directories created by the run are now tracked and removed during rollback, deepest-first, only while empty — pre-existing directories and non-empty directories are never touched.
- **SWD: rollback no longer re-attempts a failed path** - A path appearing twice in the execution order could be rolled back (and error-reported) twice when the first attempt failed; each path is now attempted exactly once.
- **Parser: traversal check is segment-based** - Path validation rejected any path *containing* `..`, which also blocked legitimate filenames like `backup..old.txt`. Only a real `..` path segment is rejected now; `resolveSafePath` continues to re-validate at execution time.
- **Heal loop: failure counting ignores zero-count phrasings** - The regression-warning heuristic counted every `fail`/`error` substring, so summaries like `# fail 0`, `0 failures`, or identifiers like `errorHandler` inflated the count. It now prefers explicit numeric counters (`3 failed`, `failures: 2`, `# fail 0`) and otherwise counts standalone tokens, skipping `no`/`0`-prefixed mentions. Extracted to `countTestFailures` in `utils.ts` (heuristic only — it never gates a decision).
- **Line endings normalized + enforced** - `src/memory.ts` and `src/commands/verify.ts` were CRLF while the rest of the repo was LF. Both are normalized to LF and a new `.gitattributes` enforces LF repo-wide, preventing false `receipts verify` drift reports on Windows checkouts with `core.autocrlf=true` (receipt hashes are byte-sensitive).

---

## [1.18.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Surplus Provider (BYOK)** - Added [Surplus](https://www.surplusintelligence.ai), an OpenAI-compatible inference marketplace on Base, as a first-class provider. Set `SURPLUS_API_KEY` (`inf_...`) to route the same models at a marketplace discount. Configurable via `MYTHOS_SURPLUS_MODEL` (default `claude-opus-4.8`) and `MYTHOS_SURPLUS_BASE_URL`. Surplus participates in the orchestrator's circuit-breaker fallback like any other provider and is detected by `mythos init`.
- **Per-Provider Price Multipliers** - The pricing engine now scales the published base price per provider via `MYTHOS_PRICE_MULTIPLIER_<PROVIDER>` (e.g. `MYTHOS_PRICE_MULTIPLIER_SURPLUS=0.7` for a 30% discount). This affects only the cost the router *estimates* for routing decisions and the budget/telemetry display — never what the provider actually bills. Defaults are `1.0`, so behavior is unchanged unless explicitly configured.

### Changed
- **Calibrated Context-Window Guard** - The chat context guard no longer assumes a fixed `chars / 4` token density. It now calibrates chars-per-token from the real input-token counts the provider returns each turn (EMA-smoothed, clamped to a 2–6 chars/token band so a prompt-cache hit or estimated-usage fallback can't poison the estimate). Code- and JSON-dense sessions are estimated more accurately, reducing both premature compression and unexpected context-limit overflow. The safety margin tightens from 1.2x to 1.1x once enough real samples have been observed.
- **Adaptive History Compression** - When compression triggers, the number of oldest turns to summarize is now adaptive: still at least the previous 60% floor, but increased when the calibrated density indicates the kept tail would not comfortably fit, so a dense session sheds enough in one pass instead of re-compressing on the next turn. At least the most recent turn is always preserved.

---

## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Receipt Undo** - `mythos receipts undo <id|latest>` replays a verified receipt in reverse. By default it previews the reversal; `--yes` applies it. Reversal actions run through the same security-policy review and SWD engine as any other write, and applying an undo produces its own verifiable receipt. Available in the SDK via `planUndo` / `executeUndo` / `undoReceipt`.
- **Stats JSON Output** - `mythos stats --json` emits machine-readable budget analytics (sessions, tokens, cost, per-command and per-project breakdowns) for CI and automation.
- **Coverage in CI** - Added a `test:coverage` script and a CI coverage report step (Node 22, Ubuntu leg).

### Security
- **Drift-Gated Undo** - Undo only reverses a file when the working tree still matches what the receipt produced, so it never clobbers newer edits (override with `--force`). Tampered receipts (integrity-hash mismatch) are refused unless forced.
- **Content-Free by Design** - Because receipts store hashes, not file content, undo fully reverses `CREATE`s (by deletion) and reports `MODIFY`/`DELETE` as not auto-reversible rather than guessing — surfacing a manual `git checkout` hint when the repo is under git. Undo can never write to a sensitive (blocked) path.

### Fixed
- **Branding Consistency** - CLI `--help` description and the package description now say "Claude Opus 4.8", matching the rest of the project.
- **Dream Duration Metric** - `dream` now records actual elapsed time instead of a hardcoded `0`.

---

## [1.16.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **External Agent Action Schema** - Added `schemas/external-agent-actions.schema.json` and `mythos swd validate --file/--stdin --json` so outside agents can validate Mythos-compatible action envelopes before apply.
- **Task Contracts** - JSON action envelopes can now include per-run `contract` boundaries with `allowedPaths`, `blockedPaths`, `requiredPaths`, and `expectedOutputs`. Contract failures stop before SWD writes anything.
- **Run Outcomes Ledger** - Added local `.mythos/runs` records plus `mythos runs list` / `mythos runs show latest` for agent/model, receipt id, blocked paths, checks, rollback state, changed files, and task-contract status.
- **Policy Suggestions** - Added `mythos policy suggest` to inspect repo structure and print suggested block/confirm guardrails without silently writing `.mythos/policy.json`.
- **MCP Validation Tool** - Added read-only MCP `swd_validate`; MCP `swd_apply` now accepts task contracts and can opt out of run logging with `saveRun: false`.
- **Compatibility Fixtures** - Added valid and invalid external-agent JSON examples for schema/contract validation.

### Security
- **Fail-Closed Contracts** - Task contract checks run before security review, sandbox checks, receipts, run history, or filesystem mutation.
- **No Raw Content in Run History** - Run records store paths, statuses, check summaries, receipt ids, and redacted errors, but not raw agent input or file contents.
- **Read-Only Policy Inspection** - Policy suggestions are advisory only and never mutate project policy automatically.

---

## [1.15.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Isolated Runs** - `mythos swd apply --check <cmd...>` and `--run-checks` test a batch in a throwaway copy of the project, run the checks there, and apply the same approved actions to the real working tree only if every check passes. Available over MCP `swd_apply` via `check[]` / `runChecks`.
- **Policy-Declared Checks** - `.mythos/policy.json` now supports a validated, capped `checks` array of `{ name, command }` gates. Declaring checks never executes them; they run only with an explicit `--run-checks` opt-in.
- **Sandbox Result in JSON** - `swd apply --json` output now includes a `sandbox` summary (per-check pass/fail and redacted output tail) for CI and automation.
- **Receipt Markdown Format Alias** - `mythos receipts show <id|latest> --format markdown` now matches MCP `receipts_show` format naming, while preserving the existing `--markdown` and `--pr` flags.

### Security
- **Fail-Closed Gating** - When isolated-run checks fail, the real working tree is never modified. The sandbox uses a 0700 temp dir, jails every write to the sandbox root (realpath + traversal rejection so a copied symlink cannot escape), excludes `.git`, caps mirrored file count, times out checks, and is always cleaned up.
- **No Implicit Execution** - A cloned untrusted repository's `policy.json` cannot trigger command execution on its own; checks run only on explicit operator opt-in, and never during `--dry-run`. Check output is secret-redacted before display or receipts.

### Fixed
- **Dry-Run Receipt Suppression** - CLI `mythos swd apply --dry-run` no longer writes SWD receipts by default, keeping preview mode side-effect-free.

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **MCP Config Helper** - Added `mythos mcp config [generic|claude|cursor]` to print paste-ready stdio MCP client configuration.
- **Project Policy File** - Added `.mythos/policy.json` for enforced repo-local SWD rules, including custom block/confirm globs, delete controls, operation allowlists, action batch limits, and write-size limits.
- **PR-Ready Receipt Markdown** - Added `mythos receipts show latest --markdown`, `--pr`, and MCP `receipts_show` `format: "markdown"` for compact, paste-ready SWD receipt summaries in PR reviews.

### Security
- **Repo-Local SWD Guardrails** - Project policy rules are enforced before filesystem mutation across `chat`, `run`, `swd apply`, and MCP `swd_apply`; malformed policy files fail closed.
- **Nested Sensitive Path Guards** - Built-in SWD safety rules now block or require confirmation for sensitive and command-affecting files inside nested project directories, preserving monorepo protection for paths such as `apps/api/.env`, `services/web/Dockerfile`, and `packages/app/package.json`.

### Fixed
- **Budget Limit Validation** - Invalid, non-finite, zero, or negative budget limits now fall back to safe defaults instead of producing meaningless percentage output.
- **Provider Circuit Breaker Tuning** - Retryable provider failures now require consecutive exhausted requests before marking a provider degraded, avoiding a five-minute penalty from one transient 503-style event.
- **Pricing Helper Documentation** - `getModelPricing` documentation now matches the implementation's conservative fallback behavior for unknown models.

---

## [1.13.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **MCP Adapter for SWD** - Added `mythos mcp`, a local stdio Model Context Protocol server that exposes Mythos SWD, receipts, and skill inspection tools to MCP-compatible agent clients.
- **MCP SWD Tools** - Added `swd_dry_run` and `swd_apply` tools that reuse the existing external-agent SWD boundary without calling a model provider, starting a daemon, or duplicating filesystem logic.
- **MCP Inspection Tools** - Added read-only MCP tools for `receipts_list`, `receipts_show`, `receipts_verify`, `skills_list`, and `skills_check`.

### Security
- **No HTTP Daemon** - The MCP adapter runs over stdio only, opens no local port, and keeps the same fail-closed sensitive path protection, rollback, and receipt behavior as `mythos swd apply`.

---

## [1.12.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **External Agent SWD Interface** - Added `mythos swd apply` so external agents can submit structured file actions to Mythos without calling a model provider or requiring an Anthropic key.
- **Model Free SWD Automation** - Added `--stdin`, `--file <path>`, and `--json` support for machine readable external agent workflows.
- **External Agent Receipt Metadata** - SWD receipts can now identify external agent/model sources for verified non-dry-run executions.

### Changed
- **Provider Key Validation** - `mythos chat` and `mythos run` now require at least one configured provider key instead of requiring Anthropic specifically, preserving Anthropic as the recommended/default provider when present.
- **README and SDK Documentation** - Documented the agent neutral SWD execution flow, security defaults, BYOK provider selection, and receipt behavior for external agent use.

### Security
- **Fail Closed External Actions** - External SWD input is size limited, schema validated, constrained to safe project relative paths, and reviewed before filesystem mutation.
- **Sensitive Path Protection** - External agent actions block `.env`, private keys, wallet files, `.git`, `.npmrc`, and secret-like paths by default. High impact command surface files and deletes require explicit `--allow-risky`.
- **No Model Execution Boundary** - `mythos swd apply` does not call Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, provider fallback, memory compression, or test-healing; it only applies and verifies supplied file actions through SWD.

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- **`mythos learn` Command** - Added deterministic repo skill generation that creates `.mythos/skills/repo/SKILL.md` from local repo structure, docs, package scripts, CI workflows, public surfaces, and security-sensitive files without running project commands or calling a model.

### Changed
- **Skill Onboarding** - Skills can now be bootstrapped from detected repository signals instead of requiring maintainers to write every rule pack from scratch.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`mythos skills` Command** - Added first-class skill pack management through `mythos skills`, `mythos skills show <name>`, `mythos skills new <name>`, and `mythos skills check`.
- **Project-Local Skill Packs** - Added `.mythos/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` support so repositories can ship their own Mythos operating rules without relying on a user's global setup.
- **Global Skill Packs** - Preserved reusable user-global skills in `~/.mythos-router/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with project-local skills taking precedence when names overlap.
- **Skill Receipt Metadata** - SWD receipts now record active skill ids, names, versions, and sources so verified edits can be reviewed with the rule packs that guided them.
- **Skill Documentation and Examples** - Added a dedicated skills guide plus example `repo` and `security-review` skill packs.
- **Skill SDK Helpers** - Exported skill loading, listing, validation, creation, and prompt-building helpers through the public SDK entry point.

### Changed
- **Project Initialization** - `mythos init` now scaffolds and checks the project-local `.mythos/skills/` directory as part of repo onboarding.
- **Skill Validation** - Skill checks now validate numeric limits, parse frontmatter arrays more consistently, and detect incompatibilities by either skill id or skill name.
- **Receipt Privacy** - Receipt skill paths are stored only when they resolve inside the current project, avoiding accidental leakage of user-global or outside-project paths.

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- **`mythos run` Command** - Added one-shot prompt execution for tasks that do not need the interactive REPL. The command accepts any prompt, runs it through Mythos once, and exits.
- **File and Stdin Prompt Sources** - `mythos run` can now read its prompt from a local file with `--file <path>` or from piped input with `--stdin`, making Mythos easier to use in scripts, task files, and editor workflows.
- **Shared Chat/SWD Pipeline** - `run` reuses the existing chat session initialization, provider routing, SWD verification, receipts, memory logging, budget tracking, skills, and branch sandboxing instead of introducing a separate execution path.
- **Bounded Run Defaults** - One-shot runs default to a smaller turn budget: one initial model turn, SWD correction turns, and optional test-healing turns only when `--test-cmd` is provided.
- **Resume-Safe Execution** - `run` records metrics as its own command but does not overwrite the resumable session used by `mythos chat --resume`.
- **`mythos init --check`** - Added a read-only setup check for environment, providers, `.mythosignore`, `MEMORY.md`, and the local skills directory without scaffolding or modifying files.

### Changed
- **Command Help Coverage** - CLI smoke coverage now checks that built help output includes the `run` and `init` commands, verifies the `run --help` prompt-source options, and covers `init --check` as a no-write smoke path.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- **SWD Rollback Drift Protection** — Rollback now uses the cached post-verification snapshot, preventing Mythos from overwriting external file changes made after verification.

### Changed
- **CI Verification Gate** — Added a GitHub Actions step to run `node dist/cli.js verify --ci` against the locally built CLI.
- **CI Hardening** — Tightened workflow permissions and install behavior.

### Security
- **Local Data Disclosure** - Documented where Mythos stores local memory, receipts, resumable sessions, metrics, cache data, and skills so users can inspect or clear private project state.

---

## [1.8.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **CI Verification Mode** — Added `mythos verify --ci`, a read-only GitHub CI mode for reviewing PR/diff changes before merge
- **Generic PR Review** — `verify --ci` now works even when no Mythos receipts are present, checking high-impact repository changes in generic PR-review mode.
- **Receipt-Aware CI Checks** — When Mythos receipts are changed under `.mythos/receipts/`, CI verifies receipt integrity and changed-file coverage.
- **Execution-Surface Detection** — Added CI checks for `package.json` script changes, npm lifecycle hooks, GitHub Actions workflows, shell/deploy/Docker surfaces, `.env`/`.npmrc` paths, private-key-like files, and high-confidence secret patterns.
- **CI Output Options** — Added `--strict`, `--json`, and `--base <ref>` options for stricter CI policies, downstream tooling, and custom git base comparisons.
- **CI Documentation** — Added `docs/CI.md` with GitHub Actions setup, exit behavior, examples, and maintainer notes.

### Changed
- **Verify Command Extension** — Extended `mythos verify` with a dedicated CI path while keeping normal local verification behavior unchanged.
- **Test-Healing Loop Refactor** — Refactored the test-healing loop in `src/commands/chat.ts` into smaller helper methods for maintainability, without changing existing chat/SWD behavior.

### Security
- **No-AI CI Verification** — `verify --ci` does not call a model, use provider fallback, modify files, execute SWD actions, or write to `MEMORY.md`.
- **Lifecycle Hook Review** — Newly added npm install lifecycle hooks such as `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall` are treated as high-severity CI findings.
- **Execution-Surface Review** — Package scripts, workflows, shell/deploy files, and other high-impact repo surfaces are flagged for review before merge.
- **Sensitive File Checks** — Added high-confidence checks for sensitive paths, private-key-like files, and secret-like material.

---

## [1.7.1] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Malformed Action Detection** — Mythos now warns when model output appears to include `[FILE_ACTION]` blocks but no valid actions can be parsed, making broken agent output easier to diagnose.
- **Safety Regression Coverage** — Added tests covering receipt redaction, dry-run wording, and oversized write blocking.

### Changed
- **Safer Receipt Output** — Receipt test-output tails are now limited to 500 characters and redact obvious API keys, tokens, and secrets before being stored locally.

### Fixed
- **Large Write Protection** — Oversized `CREATE` and `MODIFY` actions are now blocked before touching disk, reducing the risk of unsafe full-file rewrites.

---

## [1.7.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- **SWD Trust Receipts** — Added persistent receipts for SWD runs, recording verified file outcomes, request summaries, provider/model metadata, token usage, git context, test status, and an integrity hash for later audit.
- **`mythos receipts` Command** — Added receipt listing, inspection, and drift verification through `mythos receipts`, `mythos receipts show <id|latest>`, and `mythos receipts verify <id|latest>`, with `--json` output for automation.

### Fixed
- **Machine-Readable JSON Output** — Terminal cursor restoration no longer contaminates redirected stdout, keeping `--json` output parseable in CI and shell pipelines.

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **SWD Metadata Accuracy** — File hash metadata is now written only after successful, non-rolled-back SWD runs, preventing stale verification data after failed writes or rollbacks.
- **Dream Metadata Preservation** — Memory compression now preserves `mythos:file` metadata, keeping SHA-256 drift detection intact after `mythos dream`.
- **Test-Healing Drift Tracking** — Successful SWD fixes produced during test-healing now record file metadata for later verification.
- **Anthropic Timeout Handling** — Anthropic requests now receive abort signals directly, improving watchdog timeout and fallback reliability during stalled streams.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Cryptographic Drift Detection** — `mythos verify` now supports SHA-256 hash comparison for SWD-managed files. Hidden `mythos:file` metadata blocks in `MEMORY.md` store file state, allowing the verifier to detect manual edits, missing files, and unexpected content changes.
- **CLI Smoke Tests** — Added `test/cli.test.ts` to validate the build lifecycle, built CLI execution, and `verify --dry-run` behavior in isolated temporary directories.
- **Defensive Parser Limits** — Added a 250,000-character SWD block limit and stricter rejection of unsafe paths, including absolute paths, null bytes, traversal attempts, and oversized path values.

### Changed
- **Terminal Visual System** — Added semantic `theme` and `icon` constants, improved mode badges, updated session/help/exit cards, and standardized success/warning/error/info colors across CLI output.
- **Signal Handling** — Refined shutdown behavior so graceful exits return code `0`, while uncaught exceptions finalize safely and return code `1`.
- **Mutation-Safe Cache Behavior** — Updated `ResponseCache` to bypass responses containing `[FILE_ACTION:]`, preventing file-mutating responses from being cached or replayed.
- **Explicit `/clear` Confirmation** — Replaced interactive confirmation with `/clear confirm` to avoid nested readline conflicts in the chat REPL.

### Fixed
- **SWD Parser Resilience** — Fixed handling of truncated or malformed `[FILE_ACTION:]` blocks to prevent parser stalls on incomplete model output.
- **Verify Path Normalization** — Improved path normalization in `verify` to reduce false-positive drift results across relative path formats.

---

## [1.5.3] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- **Graceful Shutdown** — Removed competing `process.exit(0)` calls from `cli.ts` and `telemetry.ts` SIGINT handlers. Chat's `safeExit()` now fully owns the exit lifecycle, ensuring session save, metrics, and finalization always complete on Ctrl+C.
- **SWD Content Preservation** — Replaced `.trim()` with precise boundary-newline removal in `parseActions()` so file content whitespace (leading spaces, trailing newlines, blank lines) is preserved exactly.
- **Verify False Positives** — Fixed regex in `extractMentionedPaths()` that was including `chat:` entries and trailing semicolons as file paths, causing phantom "missing file" reports.
- **Session Resume Turn Count** — Added `SessionBudget.restore()` so resumed sessions correctly hydrate token and turn counts instead of resetting to 1.

### Security
- **Shell Safety** — `git.ts` uses `execFileSync` with argument arrays instead of string interpolation.

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- **`mythos init` Command** — Single-command project onboarding with environment validation (Node.js version, SQLite, Git), provider detection with actionable fix hints, and automatic scaffolding of `.mythosignore`, `MEMORY.md`, and skills directory.
- **Project Scaffolding** — Automatically creates `.mythosignore` with sensible defaults to prevent accidental scanning of `node_modules` and other build artifacts.

### Changed
- **Polished CLI Output** — Simplified internal jargon in user-facing logs (e.g., "derivative index" → "memory index").
- **Experimental Warning Suppression** — Automatically suppresses Node.js `ExperimentalWarning` for SQLite to maintain a premium, stable CLI experience.
- **Provider Clarity** — Explicitly labels Anthropic as `required` and others as `optional` during initialization, providing clearer setup instructions.

### Fixed
- **Dead Code Cleanup** — Removed orphan Next.js API routes that were accidentally included in the CLI repository.

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Session persistence & resume support** — Sessions are now atomically saved to `~/.mythos-router/sessions/latest.json` on exit. `mythos chat --resume` restores conversation history and budget state.
- **Context window guard** — Automatically compresses the oldest portion of conversation history when approaching token limits using a low-effort summarization step. Prevents context overflow crashes during long sessions.

### Fixed
- **CLI signal handling** — Improved handling of `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `uncaughtException`, ensuring terminal state is restored and sessions are safely persisted on exit or crash.
- **Commander.js lifecycle** — Switched to `program.parseAsync()` to properly handle async command execution and prevent unhandled promise issues.
- **Startup race condition** — Removed a dynamic import in the default help path that could cause banner inconsistencies in some environments.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Developer Experience**: Added a `BACKLOG.md` to cleanly track and categorize deferred architectural decisions and future system robustness plans.

### Fixed
- **CLI Robustness**: The terminal cursor is now safely restored if the CLI process crashes mid-animation, preventing the "invisible cursor" terminal bug.
- **Provider Concurrency**: Fixed a decrement scoping bug in the `ProviderOrchestrator` ensuring `maxConcurrency` limits are strictly enforced even under parallel SDK usage.
- **SQLite Compatibility**: Centralized `node:sqlite` loading into a single robust loader module, allowing the tool to fail gracefully instead of crashing on unsupported Node environments.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Provider Observability Dashboard** — Added the `mythos providers` command. A real-time, terminal-based dashboard that surfaces EMA latency trends, success rates, circuit breaker recovery ETAs, and a live "Leader" score. Includes a zero-flicker `--watch` mode.
- **SQLite Telemetry Backend** — Orchestration events are now persistently streamed to a dedicated `telemetry.db` using WAL pragmas and an asynchronous batching queue to guarantee zero hot-path blocking.
- **Contextual Decision Tracing** — The engine no longer just routes; it explains *why*. Routing traces now explicitly capture task type (`chat`, `code`, `analysis`), input token buckets, and latency-vs-success-rate reasoning logs.
- **Automated Retention Policies** — The telemetry engine aggressively self-prunes history, maintaining only the last 1,000 routing events and truncating error stack traces to prevent long-term database bloat.

## [1.2.1]

### Added
- **Multi-Provider Orchestration Engine** — Decoupled the core application from the Anthropic SDK. The system now supports fallback routing, adaptive watchdogs, circuit breakers, and EMA-based performance scoring across multiple providers.
- **OpenAI & DeepSeek Support** — Added a native, zero-dependency `fetch`-based provider (`OpenAIProvider`) to seamlessly support OpenAI and DeepSeek endpoints (including streaming reasoning content for `o1` and `DeepSeek-R1`).
- **Skills Protocol** — Modular expert plugins via zero-dependency YAML frontmatter parsing. Skills (`-s <skill>`) can inject customized instructions, modify budget multipliers, and enforce deterministic provider selection.
- **Deterministic Response Caching** — SDK utility for SQLite-backed response caching for pure-reasoning requests. Bypass rule strictly ensures file-mutating responses are never cached.
- **Centralized Pricing Registry** — Unified token cost calculator across different providers, feeding exact financial data into the budget metrics.
- **Auto-Healing TDD Loop** — Bounded, error-driven autonomy. Passing `--test-cmd` will automatically execute tests after a successful SWD mutation. If tests fail, the CLI intercepts `stderr`, truncates it, identifies TS/Runtime issues, and feeds it back to Claude for a self-healing iteration.
- **TDD Anti-Thrashing Guards** — The orchestrator will automatically abort the healing loop if Claude attempts the exact same fix or if output remains identically broken, preventing runaway API costs.
- **Contributor Covenant** — Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to formally establish community standards.

### Fixed
- **Stable Provider Fallback** — Fixed an edge case in the `ProviderOrchestrator` where identical EMA scores (e.g., at startup) could cause unpredictable provider routing due to JS `sort()` instability. The engine now explicitly respects user-configured priorities as a tie-breaker.

### Security
- **CodeQL Integration** — Added GitHub CodeQL scanning badge to `README.md`.
- **Dependency Audit** — Triaged and validated false-positive Socket.dev supply chain alerts for `@anthropic-ai/sdk`.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **SWDEngine v1 API** — Transactional filesystem execution kernel with `Plan → Snapshot → Execute → Verify → Rollback` lifecycle. Single entry point: `engine.run(actions)`.
- **ChatUI Abstraction** — Decoupled chat session logic from the terminal via a `ChatUI` interface. `ChatSession` is now a pure orchestrator, fully testable and reusable outside the CLI.
- **TerminalUI Implementation** — CLI-specific `ChatUI` adapter wrapping the Spinner and ANSI output.
- **SWD Lifecycle Hooks** — Extensibility layer (`onAction`, `onVerify`, `onRollback`) allowing consumers to inject logging, telemetry, or custom UI into the engine.
- **Rollback Auditability** — `SWDRunResult.rollbackErrors` field captures and reports rollback failures instead of silently swallowing them.
- **`swd-cli.ts`** — Separated SWD terminal presentation (verification output, dry-run preview, verbose traces) from the pure execution kernel.
- **Git Sandbox** — `ChatSession.setupSandbox()` for automated `mythos/` branch creation with nested-sandboxing protection.

### Changed
- **SWD Kernel is now I/O-free** — `swd.ts` contains zero `console.log` calls. All presentation lives in `swd-cli.ts`.
- **`validateApiKey()` throws instead of `process.exit(1)`** — library-safe error handling.
- **SDK exports (`index.ts`) fully updated** — removed dead symbols (`runSWD`, `parseFileActions`, `snapshotFiles`), added `SWDEngine`, `parseActions`, `SessionBudget`, `ChatUI`, and all v1 types.

### Fixed
- **🔴 Snapshot memoization bug** — `InternalSessionContext.getSnapshot('after')` was returning stale cached state on multi-action same-file scenarios. After snapshots now always re-read disk state.
- **🔴 Broken `index.ts` exports** — SDK entry point was referencing pre-refactor symbols that no longer existed.

## [1.1.9] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Budget Analytics & Cost Profiling** — Persistent tracking of token usage and API costs across all sessions, projects, and commands.
- **`mythos stats` Command** — New reporting engine for financial transparency. Aggregate costs by command, project, or time period (last N days).
- **Global Metrics Store** — Local append-only JSON store in `~/.mythos-router/metrics.json` for cross-project financial auditing.
- **Session Instrumentation** — Automated recording of chat sessions and memory compression (dream) events.

---

## [1.1.8] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Self-Healing Memory (V4)** — Re-architected memory system with a dual Authority/Derivative model. `MEMORY.md` remains the sole source of truth, backed by a rebuildable SQLite index.
- **SQLite Derivative Index** — High-performance query acceleration layer using `node:sqlite`.
- **FTS5 Smart Search** — Intelligent, ranked text retrieval via FTS5 virtual tables with `unicode61` tokenization.
- **Integrity Signposting** — SHA-256 manifest hashing on startup ensuring zero drift between the authoritative log and the search index.
- **Atomic Rebuilds** — Transactional reconstruction logic (`BEGIN/COMMIT`) to ensure index consistency even during hard crashes.

### Changed
- **O(1) Append Protocol** — Optimized logging to use `appendFileSync` for better performance and durability under load.
- **Hardened Test Suite** — Expanded testing to verify SQLite initialization, FTS5 search ranking, and recovery logic.

---

## [1.1.7] — 2026-04-19
