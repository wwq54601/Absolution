# Project Policy Example

`.mythos/policy.json` is an enforced repo-local SWD policy.

It is not a prompt hint. It applies before filesystem mutation in:

- `mythos chat`
- `mythos run`
- `mythos swd apply`
- MCP `swd_apply`

Built-in sensitive path protection still wins. A project policy cannot allow `.env`, `.npmrc`, `.git`, private keys, wallet files, or secret-like paths.

## Install The Example Policy

From a disposable test directory:

```bash
cd examples/project-policy
TMP="$(mktemp -d)"
cp policy.json blocked-mainnet.json "$TMP/"
cd "$TMP"

mkdir -p .mythos
cp policy.json .mythos/policy.json
mythos init --check
```

## What This Policy Does

The example policy:

- blocks `contracts/mainnet/**`
- blocks `infra/prod/**`
- requires confirmation for `scripts/**`
- requires confirmation for `.github/workflows/**`
- requires confirmation for `src/payments/**`
- blocks deletes
- caps action batches at 20 actions
- caps single action content at 50,000 bytes

Path patterns are matched case-insensitively by path segment. `*` matches within one segment, and `**` matches across path segments.

## Ask Mythos For Suggestions

```bash
mythos policy suggest
mythos policy suggest --json
```

This is read-only. It inspects repo structure and prints possible block/confirm patterns for surfaces such as workflows, mainnet contracts, env files, deploy scripts, payments, and production infrastructure. It never writes `.mythos/policy.json` automatically.

## Try The Blocked Action

```bash
mythos swd apply --file blocked-mainnet.json --json
```

Expected behavior:

- returns `ok: false`
- reports that project policy blocked the write
- does not write `contracts/mainnet/Vault.sol`

## Isolated-Run Checks (opt-in)

The example policy also declares verification commands under `checks`:

```json
"checks": [
  { "name": "typecheck", "command": "npm run -s build" },
  { "name": "test", "command": "npm test" }
]
```

**Declaring a check never runs it.** Checks execute only when you opt in,
in a throwaway copy of the project. The change reaches the real working
tree only if every check passes:

```bash
# Run the policy-declared checks before applying
mythos swd apply --file actions.json --json --run-checks

# Or pass ad-hoc checks without a policy file (repeatable)
mythos swd apply --file actions.json --json --check "npm test"
```

If any check fails, the apply is rejected and the real tree is untouched.
Checks are skipped during `--dry-run`. This keeps a cloned untrusted repo's
policy file from triggering command execution on its own.

Checks are trusted shell commands. Review them like package scripts or CI
commands, and do not derive them from untrusted agent output.
