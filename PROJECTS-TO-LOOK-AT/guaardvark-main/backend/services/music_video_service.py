"""Music-video pipeline state machine. DB-persisted, crash-resumable.

Owns the transition graph for a MusicVideo through its stages:
  draft → analyzing → awaiting_approval → generating → assembling → complete

Cloned 1:1 from production_service.py (the proven swarm pattern): every
transition is a single atomic UPDATE-WHERE commit, so re-dispatching at a stage
other than an agent's expected predecessor is a no-op. That idempotency is what
makes crash-resume + the per-clip tail-call dispatch (see music_video_tasks.py)
safe against double-fires.

Also home to the PURE, deterministic cut-cadence planner (`compute_cut_plan`) —
no I/O, no GPU — so it unit-tests in isolation.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (memory obs #721, the pipeline's highest functional risk):
    WAN i2v clamps every clip to ~0.7-2.0s regardless of the requested duration,
    and the MLT composer does NOT auto-stretch a source to fill a longer timeline
    slot — it leaves the remainder blank, so audio drifts over black. So before
    assembly each clip must be made exactly as long as its cut interval.

    METHODS (per-video ``settings_json.fill_method``):
    - ``forward`` (default): forward motion only — NO reverse. Slow the clip with
      ``setpts`` to cover the slot, capped at ``max_stretch`` so it never freezes;
      if the slot is still longer (rare — the planner sizes cuts to ≤
      max_clip_s×max_stretch, see compute_cut_plan), hold the last frame
      (``tpad``) for the remainder. Directional motion (walking crows) stays
      forward — this is the moonwalk fix.
    - ``boomerang``: the legacy forward+reverse concat (seamless, no loop-jump,
      but motion reverses halfway — the moonwalk). Kept as an opt-in because it
      reads fine for abstract/ambient clips.
    - ``loop``: forward repeat via input ``-stream_loop`` (continuous, clean
      timestamps; a visible jump at each loop seam but motion never reverses).

    A ``-t target_s`` hard-trims so the output is EXACT for any case — the
    assembler contract (music_video_tasks: source_out == cut_len) depends on it.
    Pure ffmpeg — zero GPU; the caller runs it OUTSIDE the GPU gate.
