"""Per-session Socket.IO bridge for cluster-routed chat streaming.

When a chat request routes to a remote node, the local node opens an
outbound socketio.Client() to the remote node's Socket.IO endpoint,
relays `chat:send` events upstream, and forwards streaming events
(chat:token, chat:complete, etc.) back down to the user's session.

Lives on whichever node receives the browser connection — NOT on master.
Each node self-bridges so master isn't a streaming bottleneck.
