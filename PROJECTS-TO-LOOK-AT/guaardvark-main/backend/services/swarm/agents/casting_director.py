- "use_existing_lora": if the Subject's name + kind matches an entry in the cast library, use that library entry's id.
- "train_from_uploads": if no library match exists and the user has provided reference images.
- "train_from_generated": if no library match and no uploads — refs will be generated from the Subject description.

Additionally, for Subjects with kind="character", assign a "voice_id" from the available voices list. If the Subject is in the library, use their existing voice_id if present.
