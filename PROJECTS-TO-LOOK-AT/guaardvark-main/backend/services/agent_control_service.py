Agent Control Service — The brain of the Agent Vision Control system.

2. Analyze with vision model (direct Ollama call)
3. LLM decides next action

target_description rules: SHORT label, ≤6 words, one distinctive adjective. Examples: "primary submit button", "chat input field", "main navigation icon", "desktop background". NOT a multi-clause description with position phrases — long descriptions break the vision detector and land at (0,0). Describe one shape (color, label, or icon), not a sentence.

For high-impact clicks (launch, submit, comment, modal dismiss), set expected_effect to the visible state that should appear after the click. Keep it short and vision-checkable.

done rule: when action="done", success_proof MUST describe the visible state that proves the task is complete (e.g. "cursor inside text area", "comment now visible in thread"). Empty or generic ("n/a", "task done") is rejected. This rule applies to all models and paths.
When your most recent history step shows [OK] for a concrete target (e.g. "GOTHAM RISING video thumbnail [OK]" or servo DPC verified change), base the success_proof directly on that target + "now visible/achieved". Prior servo-verified clicks are strong evidence the goal state is real; use them to ground your proof rather than re-inventing a description.

Full toolbox awareness (SkillOpt-style skills + tools): You have access to a large agent toolbox (code, web search/scrape, media/music, batch generation, memory/lessons, general tools, and screen control via these recipes/skills). In /agent mode with capable models (Gemma4+), use natural language to invoke any -- e.g. describe a general task to trigger tool calling, or screen task to use recipes + actions here. Recipes (skills) are optimized deterministic shortcuts for common screen patterns (triggers match natural language); the system auto-matches and executes them for reliability. For full list or self-introspection, call agent_status. Skills/recipes + self-knowledge are external (like SkillOpt .md artifacts) and can be auto-tuned from trajectories without changing model weights. Prioritize matching/using recipes for screen reliability; fall back to structured actions or general tools (use action="tool", tool_name=..., tool_params=...) as needed. Cross-model: these skills make even smaller models effective at complex multi-step work.

    # data/agent/recipes.json) claim certain UI elements are present on
    # the XFCE desktop. Phase 1 already softened "always visible" into
    # "typically visible" hedging language, but the elements are still
    # listed — and the model still primes on them. Phase 4 closes the
    # gap by tracking which claims survive contact with the actual screen:
    #
    #   1. _derive_session_expectations() parses the knowledge files once
    #      per session into a list of Expectation rows with source provenance.
    #   2. After each Phase-3 re-grounding pass, _record_expectation_contradictions
    #      compares the claimed elements against the fresh WORLD_OBSERVED
    #      block. Each "claimed visible, not observed" pair appends to
    #      _expectation_log. Stuck-target hallucinations (model said X, X is
    #      not in any doc, X is not on screen) are also logged with
    #      source="model_belief" for next-session context.
    #   3. At task end, _distill_lessons() collapses _expectation_log into
    #      <=5 lessons, dedup'd by element name. Each lesson becomes an
    #      AgentMemory row of type "belief_update" via memory_api.add_memory.
    #   4. Future sessions see the lesson through the existing
    #      get_memories_for_context loader — no extra wiring needed.
    #
    # Phase 5 (lesson_reconciler) consumes the belief_update memories
    # across sessions and proposes pending_fixes when ≥3 sessions agree
    # the same source-line claim was wrong.
