"""Action loop for system_mapper findings — turns analysis into work.

This is the difference between a read-only map and a useful tool. Findings can be:
  * ranked (high → info) and filtered,
  * dismissed (persisted, so acknowledged findings stop nagging across re-runs),
  * dispatched to the existing self-improvement agent (submit_directed_task),
    which proposes a real fix staged as a PendingFix for human review.

No fabricated diffs live here — the mapper hands a real finding to the real fix
engine rather than pretending to auto-repair. Operates on the snapshot dict the
API already holds (findings carry a stable `id` from Finding.fingerprint()).

# Finding kinds the agent can act on mechanically. Others (import cycles,

#
# DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED — never add these:
#   * dead-symbol           — static dead-code is best-effort; a wrong call deletes
#                             real recovery logic (see dead_symbol.py docstring).
#   * runtime-zombie / contextual-discovery / hot-path-spike (B4 liveness kinds) —
#     these come from a RUNTIME TRACING WINDOW. A window that simply didn't span a
#     once-a-month handler must NEVER auto-delete it. Liveness findings are advisory
#     drift signals for a human, not auto-fix candidates. Adding them here would
#     turn a missed trace into a destructive prune. Keep them out, permanently.
