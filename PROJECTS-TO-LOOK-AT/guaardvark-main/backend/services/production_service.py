"""Production pipeline state machine. DB-persisted, crash-resumable.

Owns the transition graph for a Production through its stages:
  draft → screenwriting → casting → cinematography → storyboard_gen
  → awaiting_approval → rendering → complete

The lifecycle plumbing (atomic advance, fail, resume, GPU gate) lives in
``PipelineService`` — this module only declares Production's stage graph and its
domain ``create()``. ``VALID_TRANSITIONS`` / ``STAGE_TO_AGENT`` / ``TERMINAL_STATUSES``
remain importable here for back-compat.
