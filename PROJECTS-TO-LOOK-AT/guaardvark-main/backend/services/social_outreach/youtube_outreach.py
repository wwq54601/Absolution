"""
YouTube outreach — posts comments and replies on YouTube videos via the
servo-driven Firefox on DISPLAY=:99 (which has the user's logged-in
YouTube session cookies).

Both functions return (success, reason) for audit tracking. They mirror
reddit_outreach.post_comment_via_servo's contract.

Implementation note (2026-05-13 rewrite):
  Previous version handed multi-step natural-language instruction blobs to
  service.execute_task() and relied on the see-think-act loop to figure
  out the YouTube-specific dance. That had three documented failure modes:
    • brittle composer-find on a page that scrolls past the fold
    • vision-clicked submit button that misfired on the '0 Comments' header
    • autoplay drift to a related video mid-flow

  This version chains deterministic recipes instead. Each step is one
  execute_task call whose message hits exactly one recipe in
  data/agent/recipes.json — no see-think-act lottery. The recipes:

    navigate_url               (case-preserving — task_effective post-fix)
    pause_youtube_video        (Esc + k — prevents autoplay drift)
    find_on_page               (Ctrl+F — bypasses YouTube search-bar focus theft)
    press_escape
    focus_youtube_comment_field  / focus_youtube_reply_field
    type_comment_text          / type_reply_text   (but we type the body
                                                    directly via screen.type_text
                                                    so newlines and quotes survive)
    submit_youtube_comment     / submit_youtube_reply  (Ctrl+Enter)
