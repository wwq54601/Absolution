"""
Recon agent — Phase 1 of the multi-agent outreach pipeline.

Job: scan platforms, find threads/posts/videos that match the keyword profile,
emit candidate rows for the Content agent to draft. **Never posts. Never drafts.**
The whole point of the recon split is that this phase has zero posting risk and
can run on cron without the kill-switch gate.

Today this implements Reddit (`scout_reddit`) and YouTube (`scout_youtube`).
HN / GitHub sources land in later slices —
see plans/2026-05-09-outreach-pipeline-multi-agent.md.

Reuses the existing reddit scout helpers in reddit_outreach (fetch_subreddit_rules,
fetch_hot_threads, fetch_thread_comments, thread_is_relevant) — those functions
were always platform-read-only with no servo coupling, so wrapping them is safe.
