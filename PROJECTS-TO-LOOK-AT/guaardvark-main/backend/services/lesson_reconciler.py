"""
Cross-session lesson reconciliation — Phase 5 of see-think-act-remember.

The Phase 4 belief tracker writes one `belief_update` AgentMemory per session
when an element claimed in `data/agent/self_knowledge_compact.md` (or similar
knowledge files) turns out to not be on screen. After enough sessions agree the
same claim is wrong, the *file* itself should change — not just the next-session
prompt. That's what this module does.

Workflow:

  1. Read every AgentMemory of type ``belief_update``.
  2. Group rows by (source_file, source_line, lowercased element name) using
     the structured tag set Phase 4 attaches.
  3. For each group whose count is at or above the reconciliation threshold
     (default 3) and whose source is a real file (not ``model_belief``),
     synthesise a one-line unified diff against the source file proposing a
     hedge-strengthened version of that line — and stage it as a
     ``PendingFix`` row so the user can approve/reject from the existing
     self-improvement UI.

The reconciler is deliberately *not* on the Celery beat schedule. It runs from
the CLI (``scripts/run_lesson_reconciler.py``) or from a manual API call. Auto-
firing every minute would generate noise for groups that haven't crossed the
threshold yet; auto-firing every hour would trigger surprise file edits behind
the user's back. Opt-in is the right cadence.

Errors degrade gracefully — a single malformed memory row never blocks
processing of the others.
