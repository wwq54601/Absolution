"""GlobalLoadGate — RAM + VRAM + load admission control for the whole box.

The freeze that motivated this: a self-driven GPU/model job on the single shared
16GB GPU + 60GB RAM box drove the machine into swap and locked up the operator's
PC. JobOperationGate serializes *GPU exclusivity*, but it does NOT model total
RAM/VRAM/CPU pressure — two CPU-heavy jobs (or a job plus several `claude` CLI
subprocesses, each carrying "shadow RAM") can still exhaust memory and freeze the
box without ever touching the GPU-exclusive slot.

GlobalLoadGate is a process-local admission gate. Before a heavy job starts, it
calls ``admit(JobWeight(...))``; admit blocks (up to ``timeout``) until the box
has headroom for the declared weight, or raises ``LoadGateTimeout``. It is
defense-in-depth on top of JobOperationGate, not a replacement.

Thresholds for THIS box (60GB RAM / 16GB VRAM / 16 threads):
    RAM available  < 6 GB   -> HARD block      (< 12 GB -> warn)
    swap used      > 1 GB   -> HARD block
    VRAM free      < 1.5 GB -> HARD block      (< 3 GB  -> warn)
    loadavg(1m)    > 18     -> HARD block

Intent buffer (the "shadow RAM" cover): when a job is admitted we add its
``ram_gb`` to ``reserved_ram`` and hold it for ~60s. Spawned subprocesses (e.g.
``claude`` CLIs) don't show their RAM footprint immediately; reserving up front
keeps a second admit from over-committing before the first job's children have
materialized in psutil's numbers.

LOCK-ORDERING RULE (read before composing with JobOperationGate):
    acquire the GPU-exclusive slot FIRST (JobOperationGate.gpu_exclusive), THEN
    GlobalLoadGate.admit(). Releasing happens in reverse. Acquiring the load gate
    first while waiting on the GPU slot would let a load-gate holder sit on RAM
    headroom while blocked on the GPU — a self-inflicted deadlock under
    contention.

VRAM is read via ``nvidia-smi`` subprocess (no pynvml dependency added). If
``nvidia-smi`` is missing or fails, VRAM is treated as UNKNOWN and is NOT used to
block — degrade gracefully rather than refuse all work on a CPU-only host.
