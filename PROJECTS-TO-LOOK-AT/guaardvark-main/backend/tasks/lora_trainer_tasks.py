"""Celery wiring for the lora_trainer plugin.

Same factory pattern as production_swarm_tasks. The task body is intentionally
thin: load Subject, call mock_trainer (or real trainer in v1.1), persist
results. No state-machine interaction with Production — training is per-Subject
and the cast endpoint already records the user's chosen action."""
