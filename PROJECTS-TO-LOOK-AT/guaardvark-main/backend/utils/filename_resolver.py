"""Filename collision resolver.

Single source of truth for "what to call this file when a sibling already
holds the name." Used by upload, move, generator-output, and editor-render
call sites so the rule is applied uniformly.

Rule: Files-app convention. If the desired name is unused in the target
folder, return it as-is. Otherwise append ' (2)', ' (3)', ... before the
extension. Never random hex — that's the anti-pattern this resolver exists
to retire.

Pairs with a `UNIQUE (folder_id, filename) NULLS NOT DISTINCT` constraint
on `documents` (migration 005). The constraint catches anything that
bypasses this resolver; the resolver does the work to keep the constraint
satisfied.
