# Architecture & Setup Guide

This file provides an architecture overview plus setup/build/test guidance for the project — useful for both human contributors and AI coding agents (e.g. Claude Code).

## What this is

Guaardvark is a self-hosted, offline-first AI workstation: a Flask backend, a React/Vite frontend, a Python CLI (`llx`), and 10+ GPU service plugins. Everything runs locally by default. The exhaustive feature/model/tool enumeration lives in `CAPABILITIES.md`; the marquee overview is in `README.md`.

## Running & developing

`./start.sh` is the single entry point. On first run it provisions everything: PostgreSQL, Redis, the Python venv (`backend/venv`), Node modules, schema sync, frontend build, and all services (Flask API on `:5000`, Vite UI on `:5173`). Useful flags: `--test` (health diagnostics), `--no-browser`, `--no-auto-build`, `--no-voice`. `./stop.sh` stops services; `./killswitch.sh` is the emergency full-stop (locks the codebase in the DB, kills Celery + agents — see Safety below).

For iterative work, run services individually rather than re-running `start.sh`:

```bash
# Backend (from repo root, venv active)
source backend/venv/bin/activate
export FLASK_APP=backend.app GUAARDVARK_ROOT=$(pwd)
flask run --debug --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

# Frontend (HMR)
cd frontend && npm run dev -- --host --port=5173
```

## LAN / remote access

Both servers already bind to `0.0.0.0` (Flask `FLASK_RUN_HOST`, Vite `server.host`/`preview.host`), so they're reachable at the host's LAN IP. Two allowlists gate a browser arriving from a non-localhost origin; both are driven from `.env`:

- `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` — comma-separated hosts/IPs added to Vite's host check (`vite.config.js`). Without your LAN IP here, Vite returns **"Blocked request."** Use `all` to disable the check (trusted nets only).
- `VITE_FRONTEND_URL` — your LAN origin (e.g. `http://192.168.1.108:5173`). Added to the backend REST CORS list (`backend/app.py`) and the SocketIO `cors_allowed_origins` (`backend/socketio_instance.py`); the socket handshake's `Origin` is checked even though Vite proxies the connection.

`start.sh` serves the **production build via `vite preview`**, which does *not* share the `server:` block — so `vite.config.js` repeats host-allowlist + `/api`+`/socket.io` proxy under a `preview:` block (shared `ALLOWED_HOSTS`/`PROXY` consts). The frontend calls relative `/api` and connects the socket to `window.location.origin`, relying on that proxy. `VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` is read at build time, so rebuild (re-run `start.sh`, or `npm run build`) after changing it. Caution: this exposes the full API (agent/desktop/system tooling) to anyone on the LAN — only on a trusted network, never port-forwarded to the internet.

## Tests & lint

```bash
python3 run_tests.py                              # full suite: installs deps, runs migrations, then pytest
python3 -m pytest backend/tests/test_rules.py -vv # single file (set GUAARDVARK_MODE=test, DISABLE_CELERY=true)
cd frontend && npm run lint                        # eslint, --max-warnings 0
cd frontend && npm run test                        # vitest (jsdom)
scripts/lint.sh                                    # flake8 (syntax-only: E9,E11,F63,F7,F82) + black --check
```

`run_tests.py` forces `GUAARDVARK_MODE=test` and `DISABLE_CELERY=true`; replicate those env vars when running pytest directly. Backend tests are under `backend/tests/` (mirrors source: `api/`, `services/`, `models/`, `integration/`); shared fixtures in `conftest.py`.

## Architecture

**App bootstrap (`backend/app.py`).** A Flask app singleton built by `create_app()`, guarded so it runs **exactly once per process** (`get_or_create_app()` is the accessor — never call `create_app()` directly). Holds SocketIO, SQLAlchemy, Celery, and an Executor. The `__name__ == "__main__"` guard at the top aliases `backend.app` into `sys.modules` to prevent a dual-import that would create a second Flask app and corrupt shared state.

**Blueprint auto-discovery.** API endpoints in `backend/api/` (~90 modules ending `_api.py`) are **not** registered manually — `backend/utils/blueprint_discovery.py` scans the directory and registers every Flask blueprint it finds. Add a new endpoint by dropping a module that exports a `Blueprint`; no central wiring needed. (A handful of blueprints with import-order constraints are still registered explicitly near the end of `create_app()`.)

**Tool registry (`backend/tools/` + `backend/services/agent_tools.py`).** ~70 tool classes (subclasses of `BaseTool`) registered into a global registry at startup via `backend/tools/tool_registry_init.py`. Tools carry a **category** (content, generation, desktop, agent_control, system, browser, etc.) and flags (`is_dangerous`, `requires_approval`). These categories/flags are what the MCP policy gates on — see below.

**AgentBrain (`backend/services/agent_brain.py`).** Three-tier router every chat message enters at Tier 1 and escalates only if needed: **Reflex** (<100ms, pattern match, 0 LLM calls) → **Instinct** (single pre-warmed shot) → **Deliberation** (full ReACT loop). Telemetry appends to `logs/tier_telemetry.jsonl`. State lives in `backend/services/brain_state.py`.

**MCP (`backend/mcp/`).** Bidirectional. The stdio **server** exposes tools/resources to external clients under a strict **default-deny** policy (`backend/mcp/config.py`): the `desktop`, `agent_control`, `system`, `test_execution`, `browser`, and `mcp` categories are hidden, plus anything flagged dangerous/approval-required. Only `data/outputs/` is served, read-only, as `guaardvark://outputs/...`. Config source of truth is `data/config/mcp.json`; env vars override. **When adding a tool that touches the machine, set its category/flags correctly — that is the security boundary.**

**Async work (Celery).** `backend/celery_app.py` + `backend/tasks/`. Long-running work (video render, training, self-improvement, social outreach, backups, RAG autoresearch) runs as Celery tasks; `celery beat` schedules periodic jobs. Workers use the `spawn` multiprocessing start method. Tasks fetch an app context via `get_or_create_app()`. `start_celery.sh` / `start_redis.sh` / `start_postgres.sh` bring up the dependencies.

**Plugins (`plugins/`).** Each is a self-contained GPU service (comfyui, ollama, swarm, audio_foundry, lora_trainer, upscaling, video_editor, vision_pipeline, gpu_embedding, discord, training) with a `plugin.json` manifest (id, port, `vram_estimate_mb`, endpoints, config). The **System Resource Orchestrator** arbitrates VRAM across them. Plugins run as separate processes on their own ports and are health-checked.

**Frontend (`frontend/src/`).** React 18 + Vite + Material-UI v5. `pages/` (~38 routes), `components/` (chat, agent, videoeditor, documents, swarm, …), `stores/` (Zustand for global state, React Context for layout/status). REST via Axios, realtime via `socket.io-client`, code editing via Monaco, graph views via reactflow/d3-force, VNC viewer via `@novnc/novnc`. The Vite config proxies to Flask on `:5000` and includes node polyfills for browser builds.

**CLI (`cli/llx/`).** The `llx` command (published to PyPI as `guaardvark`) — a REPL + command catalog (`commands/`, `command_catalog.py`) that talks to the backend, with its own lite server fallback. Version is single-sourced from the repo-root `VERSION` file.

## Database & schema

SQLAlchemy models in `backend/models.py` (~56 models; `db = SQLAlchemy()` shared instance). **Schema is kept in sync via `scripts/schema_sync.py`, not migration replay** — it diffs `models.py` against the live DB and applies changes (`--check` to verify only). `start.sh` and `run_tests.py` run schema sync / `scripts/check_migrations.py` automatically. After changing `models.py`, run `python3 scripts/schema_sync.py` (or `--check` in CI). Default DB URL: `postgresql://guaardvark:guaardvark@localhost:5432/guaardvark` (override via `DATABASE_URL`).

## Configuration

All paths resolve through `backend/config.py` — **never hardcode paths.** `GUAARDVARK_ROOT` anchors everything; storage/upload/output/cache/log/backup dirs are derived (`data/`, `logs/`, `backups/`) and overridable via `GUAARDVARK_*` env vars. Secrets and `DATABASE_URL` come from the repo-root `.env`. `GUAARDVARK_MODE` selects runtime mode (`default` / `test`).

## Safety-critical systems

These have real teeth — understand them before touching agent/self-improvement/outreach code:

- **Codebase lock.** `killswitch.sh` and the `codebase_locked` / `self_improvement_enabled` rows in `system_settings` (plus the `data/.codebase_lock` lockfile) gate whether the self-improvement engine may modify code. Self-improvement runs test → agent fix → verify, optionally behind an "Uncle Claude" (Anthropic API) guardian review and a Pending Fixes approval queue.
- **Outreach** (`backend/tasks/social_outreach_tasks.py`, `backend/tools/outreach_tools.py`) is **supervised by default** — drafts queue and nothing posts without explicit approval. Per-platform cadence limits, a JSONL audit trail, persona enforcement, and a global kill switch all apply. Operator identity is config-driven (do not hardcode a person — see commit history).
- **MCP default-deny** (above) is the boundary for what external clients can invoke.

## Conventions

- Commit messages: conventional format `type(scope): description` (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`).
- Python: type hints where surrounding code uses them; imports grouped stdlib / third-party / local; paths via `backend.config`.
- React: functional components + hooks; MUI v5 for UI; Zustand for global state, Context for layout.
- Keep changes focused and match surrounding style; one concern per PR.
