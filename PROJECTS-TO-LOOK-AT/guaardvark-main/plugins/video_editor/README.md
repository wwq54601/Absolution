# Video Editor

Bin-driven montage assembly. Drop B-roll into a project bin, pick a song, click **Plan** — the **Art Director** (vision model) reads each clip, picks a filter, decides which clip goes in which section of the song, and emits an arrangement. Click **Render** to get a Shotcut-readable `.mlt` and a final `.mp4`. Click **Open in Shotcut** if you want to refine anything by hand.

The end-state goal is the Batch Video Generator workflow: pick a Style Recipe, click **Quick Render**, walk away.

## Workflow

```
Drop clips into Bin    ←  Library drag, OS file drop (uploads to data/uploads/Videos/)
Drop song into Song    ←  Library drag, OS file drop (uploads to data/uploads/Audio/)
Pick Style Recipe      ←  Default | Grunge | Dark | Cinematic | Music Video
Pick Detection mode    ←  Audio | Motion | Both (strict) | Both (loose)
                              └─ defaults to Both (strict)

## Style Recipes

JSON files under `data/agent/style_recipes/`. A recipe biases the Art Director and constrains its filter/transition palette. Bundled recipes:

| Recipe | Look | Filter palette | Transitions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Default** | No bias, full catalog | all | all |
| **Grunge** | High-contrast B&W, oldfilm, distorted | `high-contrast-bw oldfilm vignette wave-distort desaturate` | `hard-cut dip-to-black` |
| **Dark** | Cool, vignetted, mysterious | `cool-tint vignette desaturate slow-zoom-in` | `hard-cut cross-dissolve dip-to-black` |
| **Cinematic** | Warm-tinted, dissolves, slow zooms | `warm-tint vignette slow-zoom-in pan-left` | `cross-dissolve luma-circle` |
| **Music Video** | High-energy, vertigo zooms, wipes | `warm-tint cool-tint vertigo slow-zoom-in glow` | `hard-cut luma-wipe luma-circle` |

Author a new recipe by dropping a JSON in the directory — the loader picks it up. See `data/agent/style_recipes/README.md` for the schema.

## Filter catalog

| Category | Slugs |
| --- | --- |
| Color | `warm-tint` `cool-tint` `high-contrast-bw` `sepia` `desaturate` |
| Motion | `slow-zoom-in` `vertigo` `pan-left` |
| Stylize | `oldfilm` `vignette` `glow` |
| Glitch | `pixelate` `wave-distort` |

Plus `none` for no filter. All are real MLT filter services — generated `.mlt` files open with editable filter objects in Shotcut.

## Transition catalog

`hard-cut` (no overlap), `cross-dissolve` (0.4s), `dip-to-black` (0.6s), `luma-circle` (0.5s), `luma-wipe` (0.5s).

Non-hard-cut transitions force clip placement on alternating V1 / V2 tracks with the right overlap region; a `<transition>` element bridges them on the tractor.

## Output paths

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `data/uploads/Videos/` | OS-dropped bin clips |
| `data/uploads/Audio/` | OS-dropped songs |
| `data/outputs/videos/mlt-projects/` | Generated `.mlt` files (open in Shotcut) |
| `data/outputs/videos/editor-renders/` | Final `.mp4` files |
| `data/outputs/videos/clip-scans/` | Vision-analysis cache (`<hash>.json` per clip) |
| `data/outputs/videos/clip-scans/frames/<hash>/` | Sampled JPEG frames the Art Director saw |
| `data/outputs/videos/auto-editor-scans/` | auto-editor kdenlive XML per scan |

Both `.mlt` and `.mp4` outputs are registered as Documents and show up in the Documents tree.

## Architecture notes

### CrewInterface

The Art Director sits behind a Protocol:

```python
class CrewInterface(Protocol):
    def analyze_clip(self, frames, clip_id, source_path, recipe) -> ClipAnalysis: ...
    def arrange(self, clip_analyses, song, kept_ranges_by_clip, recipe, seed) -> Arrangement: ...
```

`LocalArtDirector` is v1: in-process vision-model call via Ollama + rule-based arranger. When the `film_crew` plugin eventually lands, `FilmCrewClient` (HTTP client to that plugin) drops in with a one-line change in `service/app.py`. **Don't bypass the interface** in call sites — keep model specifics behind it.

### Pipeline orchestration

`service/jobs_pipeline.py` runs four ordered stages, all instrumented for progress reporting:

1. `analyze_mod.analyze_clip` per bin clip → kept-ranges (parallelizable later; currently sequential).
2. `analyze_song` → tempo + 4-section labeled energy split.
3. `frame_sampler.sample_frames` + `crew.analyze_clip` per clip → ClipAnalysis (cached by content hash).
4. `_apply_overrides` if any → `crew.arrange` → Arrangement.

Caches live keyed by file content hash (`(path, mtime, size)` sha256, 16 chars) so the same clip used in two projects shares the same cached vision read.

### Track placement (multi-clip render)

`mlt/timeline_compose.compose_arrangement` walks the arrangement and decides which video track each clip lands on:

- A run of `hard-cut` clips stays on a single track (V1, `playlist0`).
- A non-hard-cut `transition_to_next` swaps the next clip onto the other track.
- Audio always sits on its own track (`playlist_audio`).
- The chosen transition's overlap (e.g. 0.4s for cross-dissolve) extends both clips into the overlap region; a `<transition>` element on the tractor bridges them.

Same source path used multiple times in the arrangement → one shared chain (the LAST filter recommendation wins for that chain). Per-instance filters need filter-track tracks — deferred.

### Drift safety

All time math is anchored to t=0 absolute frames (`frame_math.seconds_to_absolute_frame`). Never delta-accumulate. Verified by `test_frame_math.test_no_drift_over_200_cuts_*`.

## Plugin lifecycle

```bash
# bring it up
bash plugins/video_editor/scripts/start.sh

# bring it down
bash plugins/video_editor/scripts/stop.sh

# logs
tail -f logs/video_editor.log
```

First boot creates `plugins/video_editor/venv/` and installs ~250 MB of deps
(librosa, numba, auto-editor, fastapi, lxml). Subsequent boots are <2s.

`config.yaml` overrides:
- `melt.path` — explicit `melt` binary. Auto-resolved from `/snap/shotcut/current/melt` (the wrapper script, NOT `/bin/melt`).
- `auto_editor.path` — explicit `auto-editor` binary. Defaults to the one installed in the plugin venv.
- `output.mlt_projects_dir`, `output.renders_dir` — output paths (relative to project root).
- `registration.backend_url` — where to POST output Documents (default `http://localhost:5002`).
- `beat_sync.subdivision` / `min_clip_seconds` / `tightness` — librosa pacing defaults.

## Linux & macOS Setup (melt / Shotcut for Video Editor + Music Video)

The editor and music-video assembly require `melt` (MLT renderer from Shotcut) + `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (already installed by the core platform scripts on both OSes). `auto-editor` is bundled in the plugin venv.

**macOS (Homebrew recommended)**
```bash
# Shotcut cask includes melt + GUI (preferred for "Open in Shotcut")
brew install --cask shotcut

# Or just the melt binary
brew install mlt
```
- `melt` will be in PATH (or `/opt/homebrew/bin/melt`).
- ffmpeg is installed automatically by Guaardvark's macOS bootstrap (see `scripts/platform/macos.sh` and recent Homebrew fixes).
- Override if needed: edit `plugins/video_editor/config.yaml` → `melt.path`.

**Linux**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (apt)
sudo apt-get install -y melt ffmpeg shotcut

# Flatpak (works on most distros, including Fedora/Arch)
flatpak install flathub org.shotcut.Shotcut

# Snap (original default)
sudo snap install shotcut
```
- After install: `which melt` should succeed.
- For non-standard locations set `melt.path` in `config.yaml` or `VIDEO_EDITOR_MELT_PATH` env before starting the plugin.
- WSL/other: use apt or the distro's equivalent + ensure ffmpeg is present.

**Verification**
```bash
which melt
which ffmpeg
which ffprobe
# Test inside the plugin (after it starts):
curl http://localhost:8207/status   # will show "melt_resolved_path"
```

**"Open in Shotcut"**
- Best-effort cross-platform launcher.
- On macOS it tries the .app bundle if the binary isn't in PATH.
- You can always open the generated `.mlt` file manually from `data/outputs/videos/mlt-projects/`.

**Notes**
- The plugin itself is CPU-only (no VRAM). Heavy video *generation* (batch / music video clips) still benefits from NVIDIA CUDA or Apple Silicon MPS (see offline video generator notes).
- Generated `.mlt` files are standard Shotcut format and open on any OS that has Shotcut.
