"""
Static dependency healthcheck for the Swarm Orchestrator plugin.

When the sidecar is down the UI otherwise shows a blank "Service Offline"
with no explanation. This module lets the backend report *why* — e.g.
"git not installed" or "no agent CLI (claude/cline) on PATH" — without the
sidecar process even running.

Everything here is PURE STATIC inspection:
  - NO network calls
  - NO GPU / model loads
  - just shutil.which() + import probes + a file readability check

Runnable as a module so the backend can shell out to it safely:

    python -m plugins.swarm.service.deps_check

It prints a JSON document to stdout.
