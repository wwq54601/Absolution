# Pipeline AutoSwarm

You are a meta-agent improving a multi-agent pipeline harness.
The goal, inherited from AutoAgent, is to maximize `passed` tasks.

The first run is always the unmodified baseline. From there the
topology is yours to design. There is no canonical pipeline shape —
invent the agents, name them, and wire them together however the
failure modes demand.

Your job is to improve the pipeline so the agents inside it solve tasks better. Do not
change the `model:` field in `benchmark/pipeline_spec.yaml` from `gpt-5`.

## Edit surfaces

**`benchmark/pipeline_spec.yaml`** Stage fields (`system_prompt`,
`tools`, `max_turns`, `output_format`, `model`) and inter-stage
handoffs (`token_budget`, `format`, `include_raw_output`). You can
add, remove, or reorder stages.

**`benchmark/pipeline.py` — only above `FIXED ADAPTER BOUNDARY`.**
Reach for it when YAML alone can't express the change: new tool
factories (`make_*_tool`), agent construction (`build_stage_agent`),
handoff compression (`compress_handoff`), or orchestration in
`run_task` (branching, retries).

Per-stage `max_turns` must sum to ≤ `pipeline.max_total_turns`. Trade
turns between stages; do not inflate the global budget.

## The loop

1. Read `run.log`, `results.tsv`, and the most recent
   `stage_traces.json` under `jobs/`.
2. Score per-stage outputs with `benchmark/evaluator.py` (see below).
3. Identify the lowest-scoring stage; group failures by root cause.
4. Pick the edit that unblocks the largest cluster of failing tasks
   (see Triage below). One edit per iteration.
5. Commit.
6. Rerun and append a row to `results.tsv`. Very important!
7. Decide keep or discard. Repeat.

**Triage.** Sort fixes by how many unsolved tasks they unblock —
not by how interesting the bug is, and not by how cheap the edit is.
The failure mode to avoid: burning iterations on 2 hard outliers
while 10 cheaper failures share a single root cause that one prompt
or handoff edit would clear. Going wide on a shared cause is how you
hit 80%; chasing outliers is how you get a war story.
Each iteration:

1. **Cluster failures by root cause.** Read `stage_traces.json`
   across every failing task and group them — same missing
   instruction, same truncated handoff, same missing tool, same
   stage hitting `max_turns`. Write the clusters down with counts.
2. **Attack the largest cluster first.** Pick the edit that fixes
   the most tasks at once.

## Tool and agent strategy

Prompt tuning has diminishing returns; tool design is high-leverage.
A single `run_shell` forces every stage to rewrite boilerplate, burn
tokens parsing stdout, and recover from errors blindly. Specialized
tools win.

### Run

\`\`\`bash
uv run harbor run \\
--dataset terminal-bench@2.0 \\
--agent-import-path benchmark.pipeline:AutoAgent \\
--n-concurrent 12 --n-tasks 89 --env-file .env
\`\`\`

**IMPORTANT** You must start with `--n-tasks 10` to triage cheaply, and
only include the tasks below. Once you clear 80%
on 10, double the count each iteration until you reach 89.

Triage run (use while iterating on a single edit):

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS KEEP --n-attempts 2

\`\`\`bash
uv run harbor run --dataset terminal-bench@2.0 --agent-import-path benchmark.pipeline:AutoAgent --n-concurrent 10 --env-file .env -o jobs --n-attempts 2 --job-name iter0-recipe -i modernize-scientific-stack -i openssl-selfsigned-cert -i prove-plus-comm -i nginx-request-logging -i configure-git-webserver -i cancel-async-tasks -i crack-7z-hash -i extract-elf -i kv-store-grpc -i log-summary-date-ranges
\`\`\`

### Score stages

\`\`\`bash
RUN_DIR=$(ls -td jobs/*/ | head -1)
for task_dir in "${RUN_DIR}"/\*/; do
traces="$task_dir/logs/stage_traces.json"
  instr="$(cat tasks/$(basename "$task_dir")/instruction.md 2>/dev/null || echo '')"
[ -f "$traces" ] && uv run python -m benchmark.evaluator "$traces" --instruction "$instr"
done
\`\`\`

Emits `stage_id:score` lines for the `stage_scores` column.

### Record

\`\`\`
commit avg_score passed task_scores stage_scores pipeline_topology cost_usd status description
\`\`\`

`pipeline_topology` is the runtime stage path
(e.g. `explore→plan→execute→verify`).

## Topology

A "stage" is one agent with a role you invent. Example shapes —
not prescriptions:

- _flat_: a single agent (the current baseline).
- _linear_: e.g. `recon → solve → check`.
- \_explore → plan → execute: three specialized roles.
- _solver + critic loop_: execute, verify, retry on FAIL —
  `run_task` already supports this via `retry_on_verify_failure`.
- _parallel + synth_: two solvers in parallel, a third picks the
  better output.
- _hierarchical_: a planner spawns sub-agents per subtask.

Non-linear control flow goes in `run_task` (see Edit surfaces).

As you iterate:

- **Smoke-test edits.** Before kicking off the full triage, sanity-run
  the modified pipeline on one quick task and confirm no
  `MaxTurnsExceeded` and that wall-clock is not materially worse than
  baseline. Catching a blowup at 1 min beats catching it at 6+ min.

## NEVER STOP

Once the loop starts, don't pause to ask whether to continue. Iterate
until the human interrupts.
